    <h3 id="life">Life Story:</h3>
         <p>Chip was born in Los Angeles, where he was abanonded on the street and ended up in a kill shelter. He was rescued and brought to New York City, where he was adopted into his forever home. He loves the NYC apartment life, lounging in sunny windows, stretching on the couch and playing fetch. He is well adapted to smaller spaces and happy to spend all day with his humans. He enjoys traveling upstate to the family farm where he chases squirrels and chipmunks, and lays in front of the fireplace during winter. 
           <br><br>
 After moving to NYC Chip started going on long cross country road trips, running, rock climbing, and hiking. He honed his skills for air travel, and found ways to make cars rides more tolerable. During this time he traveled to over 35 states.
           <br><br>
           In 2020 Chip went on his first thru hike of Vermont's Long Trail, 273 miles from Canada to Massachusetts. He learned many tricks to stay healthy and keep his weight on, while hiking over the high peaks across Vermont. In 2021 Chip was ready for the 2,653 mile Pacific Crest Trail, from Mexico to Canada. Chip hiked through deserts, high mountain ranges, old-growth forest, alpine tundra, grassland, and rainforests. In 2022 he hiked the 2,190 mile Appalacian Trail from Georgia to Maine, in only 68 days! You might not think it by looking at him, but Chip is a true athlete.
           <br><br>
           These days Chip relaxes at home, enjoys family trips across the country, and shows off his wardrobe on the NYC streets.</p>
